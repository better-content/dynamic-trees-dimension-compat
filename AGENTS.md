## Commit discipline

Commit after each coherent completed change. Run the documented validation before committing and push the current branch; do not leave completed work uncommitted or unpushed unless the user explicitly asks.

## Validation

Run `./gradlew verifyFast` for the deterministic CI-equivalent lane. Use `./gradlew verifyFull` when a change affects Forge runtime or GameTest behavior and the task defines that lane.

Do not commit build outputs, runtime worlds, logs, IDE state, downloaded dependency JARs, or generated caches.
